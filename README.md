# Digital ID Verification System

The objective of this project is to design and develop an end-to-end digital ID verification system that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models and advanced techniques like LayoutLM with optimized attention mechanism and federated training with multilingual Tesseract. The system aims to accurately extract relevant information from ID documents, such as name, date of birth, and ID number, and compare the layout and structure of different documents to identify potential duplicates and falsifications.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Deep Learning Models:** The system utilizes the LayoutLM model, trained on a large and diverse dataset of ID documents, to extract information and analyze the layout and structure of documents.

- **Optimized Attention Mechanism:** The attention mechanism of the LayoutLM model has been optimized to improve its accuracy and efficiency in capturing important details from ID documents.

- **Federated Training with Multilingual Tesseract:** The system employs federated training techniques with multilingual Tesseract, enabling the model to recognize text in various languages, making it adaptable to diverse ID document types.

- **Backend Verification Process:** In addition to information extraction, the system incorporates an optimized backend verification process. This process includes cross-referencing the extracted information with government databases and performing biometric checks to ensure the authenticity of the ID documents.

## Benefits

- **Increased Security:** By accurately extracting and analyzing information from ID documents, the system enhances security measures and reduces the risk of identity fraud and document falsification.

- **Efficient Integration:** The digital ID verification system is designed to be easily integrated into various applications and systems, enabling organizations to incorporate reliable identity verification measures seamlessly.

- **Trust in the Digital World:** With a robust and reliable verification system in place, users can have increased trust in the digital realm, knowing that their identities are protected and verified with accuracy.
